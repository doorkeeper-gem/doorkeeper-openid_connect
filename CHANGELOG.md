## v1.7.1 (2020-02-07)

### Upgrading

This version adds `on_delete: :cascade` to the migration template for the `oauth_openid_requests` table, in order to fix #82.

For existing installations, you should add a new migration in your application to drop the existing foreign key and replace it with a new one with `on_delete: :cascade` included. Depending on the database you're using and the size of your application this might bring up some concerns, but in most cases the following should be sufficient:

```ruby
class UpdateOauthOpenIdRequestsForeignKeys < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def up
    remove_foreign_key(:oauth_openid_requests, column: :access_grant_id)
    add_foreign_key(:oauth_openid_requests, :oauth_access_grants, column: :access_grant_id, on_delete: :cascade)
  end

  def down
    remove_foreign_key(:oauth_openid_requests, column: :access_grant_id)
    add_foreign_key(:oauth_openid_requests, :oauth_access_grants, column: :access_grant_id)
  end
end
```

- [#97] Fixes for compatibility with Doorkeeper 5.2 (thanks to @linhdangduy)
